# CalculatorApp
Here i produced a basic functioning calculator which performs basic functions such addition,subtraction, division and so on.
I used my new knowledge of producing a class to store the GUI components, JButtons and Jtextfields. I was introduced into how to apply the use of actionListners and making the JButton
interact when the user has clicked on any given button.
This task proved tricky initially due to i had previously attemped to add the JButtons in a static manner but was introduced into a way of adding JButton through the 
use of the for loop.
This was my first "major" project which consisted on a solid user interface.
